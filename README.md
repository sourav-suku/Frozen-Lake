## RL_Frozen-Lake
• Implemented a frozen lake scenario given the inputs, number of holes (M) and size of the lake (N) (Assumed the lake is square). Starting point will be (0, 0) and goal will be to reach at (N-1, N-1)

• Used Reinforcement Learning and Q - learning  method to solve the Frozen Lake Problem.

• Used Value Iteration to work out a learning rule for q-value for each state-action pair.

• Trained the RL agent for different values of discount factors and learning rates and after 3000 iterations successfully learned a path from source to goal.
